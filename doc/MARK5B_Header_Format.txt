# MARK5B Header Format (consists of 4 32-bit words):
#  Word0: sync word 0xABADDEED
#  Word1:
#    bits 0..14 (mask 0x00007fff): BINARY frame number within second, which
#          depends on the sampling rate decided for the observation.
#    bit 15 (mask 0x00008000): marked as T. Signals the presence of the
#          Test Vector Generator, random noise produced by the formatter to
#          test the hardware. It is occasionally included into the frame
#          number section like when the sampling rate of the VLBI experiment
#          rises over 2 Gbit/s.
#    bits 16..31 (mask 0xffff0000): User-specified 16 bits.
#  Word2:
#    4-byte BCD time code 0xJJJSSSSS.
#          The first three hexadecimal digits (mask 0xfff00000) represent
#          a shortened Modified Julian Date day (JJJ)
#          The last five hexadecimal digits (mask 0x000fffff) are the second
#          of the day starting from 0 at midnight (SSSSS).
#  Word 3:
#    bits 0:15 (mask 0x0000ffff) the 16-bit CRCC code (usually marked
#          as zeros). 
#    bits 16..31 (mask 0xffff0000) the fractional part of the
#          second (.SSSS)
